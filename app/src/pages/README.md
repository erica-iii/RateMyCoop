# `pages` Folder

This folder contains all the pages that will be part of the application. Details on required numbers will be provided in the Phase 3 documentation.

These pages are meant to show you an example of some of the features of Streamlit and the way we will limit functionality access by role/persona. It is not meant to represent a complete application.

TODO: Describe the pages folder and include link to documentation. Don't forget about ordering of pages.

The pages folder identifies pages in the app by the directory structure and filenames which allows for distinct functionalities and/or sections. Since each page is independent, it allows for modularity and gives the ability to limit access to certain users. The page order determines the display sequence, and by using number prefixes, allows us to control this function.
