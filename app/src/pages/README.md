# `pages` Folder

The pages folder identifies pages in the app by the directory structure and filenames which allows for distinct functionalities and/or sections. Since each page is independent, it allows for modularity and gives the ability to limit access to certain users. The page order determines the display sequence, and by using number prefixes, allows us to control this function.
